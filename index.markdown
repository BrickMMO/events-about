Events is a BrickMMO project management application that allows users to register as guests without having to sign up for an account. Additionally, admins can add, edit and delete various events that BrickMMO is holding.

This application will provide BrickMMO users with a detailed list of each available event. In this list, they can see an image of the event, the title, date, location, and a button to go to the details of the events.

This application will be written in PHP as the server-side language and will use MySQL as data storage. Additionally, it will use Vanilla CSS and Bootstrap to give style to the web application so that the style can match the one used in the [BrickMMO Website](https://brickmmo.com/).
